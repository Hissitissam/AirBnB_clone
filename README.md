<p>This is the first step towards building our first ALX full web application: <b>the AirBnB clone</b>. This first step is very important because we will use what we build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…</p>


<p>This is the Server Side (back-end) of our web application: <b>the AirBnB clone</b>. We store the data in a JSON file, as you can see in the photo below.</p>
